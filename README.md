## Note

The screen resolution I use is 2240x1400, which means if you use a different one some things might be in the wrong position. Feel free to fork this repository and make your own edits!

# Keybinds/Shortcuts

For a list of all the keybinds, please refer to my [hyprland.conf](https://github.com/FireStreaker2/dotfiles/blob/mumei/hypr/hyprland.conf) file. For waybar shortcuts, check out my waybar [config](https://github.com/FireStreaker2/dotfiles/blob/mumei/waybar/config).
